MECH2700 : Engineering Analysis I 
---------------------------------
Example code (week 7)

A basic example of how to analyse a truss structure using linear equations. 
Given the height of the truss, and the length of each beam, the geometrical relations 
and forces between nodes can be analysed in both x- and y- components. Each equation
can be represented as a row in a matrix, as shown in the comments.
